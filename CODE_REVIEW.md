*Book Search Template*
- add a space after the comma in authors.join(',')
- if b.publisher is undefined, do not include the div ('Publisher:   ' looks awkward)

*Reading List Component*
- removeFromReadingList argument should have a type

*Reading List Module*
- seperate imports by core imports, third party imports, application imports
- alphabetical order for imports (within groupings)

*Books Search Actions*
- for consistency, action should be [Books Search Bar] instead of [Book Search Bar]
